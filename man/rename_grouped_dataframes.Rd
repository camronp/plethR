\title{Rename Data Frames by Group and Parameter}
\usage{
rename_grouped_dataframes(df_list_clean, group_mapping, group_names)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_list_clean}{A list of data frames, each representing a dataset to be renamed.}

\item{group_mapping}{A named list where each group (name) is associated with a numeric vector of sheet indices.}

\item{group_names}{A character vector of custom names for the groups. The length must match the number of groups in
`group_mapping`.}
}
\value{
A named list of data frames with updated names.
}
\description{
This function assigns custom names to data frames in a list based on user-defined group and sheet mappings.
It appends numeric suffixes to distinguish data frames within the same group and ensures no duplicate names are assigned.
}
\details{
This function renames individual data frames in the input list (`df_list_clean`) according to the user-defined group names
and their respective sheet indices from `group_mapping`. The new names are constructed by appending a numeric suffix to the
group name (e.g., "Group A 1", "Group A 2"). This is particularly useful for workflows where merging is not desired,
but clear and consistent naming of data frames is needed.

\examples{
# Example data frame list
df_list <- list(df1, df2, df3, df4)

# Define group mappings and names
group_mapping <- list("Group A" = c(1, 2), "Group B" = c(3, 4))
group_names <- c("Group A", "Group B")

# Rename the data frames
renamed_dfs <- rename_grouped_dataframes(df_list, group_mapping, group_names)

# Access renamed data frames
names(renamed_dfs)
# [1] "Group A 1" "Group A 2" "Group B 1" "Group B 2"
